# SOV_Data

**SOV_Data** is a Morrowind modders' resource for creating colder, snowy biomes set in the north of [Sheogorad](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sheogorad) and the [Sea of Ghosts](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sea_of_Ghosts), or adding more variety to landscapes set in Sheogorad and [Azura's Coast](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Azura%27s_Coast)

Previously a part of the mod [Secret of Vilmuhn](https://morrowind-modding-with-massivejuice.vercel.app/00-projects/secret-of-vilmuhn/secret-of-vilmuhn-home/) by GrumblingVomit and MassiveJuice, the assets have now been forked off into their own separate ESM so they can be used independently of Secret of Vilmuhn. SOV_Data features a large number of retextured and reworked assets from OAAB_Data and Tamriel_Data, without which neither it nor Secret of Vilmuhn would be possible.

## Features

- **Retextured Nord barrow exterior and interior sets**, using regional AC/SG rock textures instead of the Skyrim-style rock used in Tamriel_Data's Nord barrows. This gives a more localized flavour to the ruins of ancient Nordic forts and barrows which might be found in the north of Vvardenfell - remnants of its ancient Nordic occupation.
- **Menhir variants** based on retextured Bloodmoon rocks, as a way to break up the monotony of vanilla's endlessly repetitive menhirs. Includes more snowy variants of menhirs based on Bloodmoon rocks.
- **New AC/SG cliffs and rocks** based off various OAAB and TD cliffs, including large boulders and grassy-rocks found in [SHoTN](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44921/). Includes snowy variants.
- **New landscape textures**
	- `GVMJ_AC_Darkgravel_Snow`: Snowy variant of vanilla's `Tx_land_darkgravel`
	- `GVMJ_dwrv_road_snow`: Snowy variant of OAAB_Data's `AB_tx_DwrvRoadDirt`
	- `GVMJ_DS1_SnwIce`: A rework of `Tx_BM_snow_rock_01` with the ice-layer instead laid over the vanilla `Tx_land_darkstone01`. Useful for icy mountain-peaks
- **New AC/SG interior cave set**, based off OAAB's freeform cave set, utilising AC Darkstone textures for a unique spin on Morrowind caves.

## Credits

Tamriel_Data: a huge number of assets from Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel have been adapted for this mod, so an enormous thank you to all the members there for allowing us to adapt these meshes for Secret of Vilmuhn. Some examples are the retextured Nord Barrow set and grassy rocks from SHOTN, or the mountain peak meshes from TR and PC.  
  
OAAB_Data: a large number of OAAB_Data meshes have also been updated, so a massive thanks also goes to MD and the team. Some examples are the freeform cave meshes and rocks, or the dwarven road
